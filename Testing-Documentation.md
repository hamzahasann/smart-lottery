### 3.2 Security Testing

Security testing involves assessing the smart contract and DApp for vulnerabilities that could be exploited maliciously. Tools and methodologies used include static analysis, dynamic analysis, and manual code reviews.

#### Testing Strategy

- **Static Analysis:** Using automated tools like Slither and Mythril to scan the smart contract for common vulnerabilities.
- **Manual Code Review:** Inspecting the smart contract code to identify logical flaws or potential security issues.
- **Best Practices Verification:** Ensuring adherence to Solidity and smart contract development best practices.

### 3.3 Performance Testing

Performance testing evaluates the efficiency and responsiveness of the Lottery DApp under various conditions. This includes assessing gas consumption, transaction throughput, and system behavior under load.

#### Testing Strategy

- **Gas Consumption Analysis:** Measuring the gas usage of each smart contract function to ensure cost-effectiveness.
- **Load Testing:** Simulating multiple users interacting with the DApp simultaneously to assess its scalability and responsiveness.
- **Stress Testing:** Pushing the system beyond normal operational capacity to observe how it handles high traffic and identify breaking points.
