## 2. System Architecture & Design

### 2.1 Smart Contract Architecture

The smart contract, `Lottery.sol`, is the backbone of the Lottery DApp. It manages participant entries, winner selection, and prize distribution.

**Key Components:**

- **State Variables:**
  - `manager`: Address of the contract deployer with exclusive rights to pick a winner.
  - `players`: Dynamic array storing participants' addresses.
  - `winner`: Address of the selected winner.
  - `isComplete`: Boolean indicating if the lottery has concluded.
  - `claimed`: Boolean indicating if the prize has been claimed.

- **Modifiers:**
  - `onlyManager`: Restricts certain functions to the contract manager.

- **Functions:**
  - `constructor()`: Initializes the contract by setting the deployer as the manager.
  - `enter()`: Allows users to participate by sending at least 0.1 ETH.
  - `pickWinner()`: Manager-exclusive function to randomly select a winner.
  - `claimPrize()`: Enables the winner to claim the prize.
  - Getter functions: `status()`, `getManager()`, `getWinner()`, `getPlayers()`.

**Randomness Mechanism:**

The contract uses a pseudo-random number generator leveraging `block.prevrandao`, `block.timestamp`, and `players.length`.

### 2.2 Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using **React** and facilitates user interactions with the smart contract through **Ethers.js v6**. It comprises two main pages:

- **Home Page:**
  - Allows users to enter the lottery or claim prizes.
  - Displays the current lottery status and user's participation status.

- **PickWinner Page:**
  - Restricted to the contract manager.
  - Enables the manager to pick a winner and view the result.

**Routing:**

Implemented using **React Router**, enabling seamless navigation between the Home and PickWinner pages.

**State Management:**

Utilizes React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage and update the application's state based on blockchain data and user interactions.

### 2.3 Technology Stack

- **Smart Contract Development:**
  - **Solidity:** Version ^0.8.0 for writing the `Lottery.sol` contract.
  - **Hardhat:** Version ^2.22.17 for compiling, deploying, and testing contracts.
  - **Ethers.js:** Version 6.13.4 for blockchain interactions.

- **Frontend Development:**
  - **React:** Version ^18.2.0 for building the user interface.
  - **React Router DOM:** Version ^7.1.1 for client-side routing.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Smart Contract Implementation

The `Lottery.sol` smart contract encapsulates all lottery-related functionalities.

**Key Implementations:**

- **Entry Mechanism:**
  - Users enter the lottery by invoking the `enter()` function and sending a minimum of 0.1 ETH.
  - Entries are recorded in the `players` array.

- **Winner Selection:**
  - The `pickWinner()` function allows only the manager to select a winner.
  - Utilizes a pseudo-random number generator to pick a winner from the `players` array.
  - Marks the lottery as complete upon selecting a winner.

- **Prize Claiming:**
  - The `claimPrize()` function allows the winner to transfer the entire contract balance to their address.
  - Ensures that the prize is only claimed once.

**Code Snippet:**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Lottery {
    address public manager;
    address payable[] public players;
    address payable winner;
    bool public isComplete;
    bool public claimed;

    constructor() {
        manager = msg.sender;
        isComplete = false;
        claimed = false;
    }

    modifier onlyManager() {
        require(msg.sender == manager, "Only manager can call this.");
        _;
    }

    function enter() public payable {
        require(msg.value >= 0.1 ether, "Not enough ETH");
        require(!isComplete, "Lottery already completed");
        players.push(payable(msg.sender));
    }

    function pickWinner() public onlyManager {
        require(players.length > 0, "No players");
        require(!isComplete, "Lottery already completed");
        winner = players[randomNumber() % players.length];
        isComplete = true;
    }

    function randomNumber() private view returns (uint) {
        return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.prevrandao, block.timestamp, players.length)));
    }

    function claimPrize() public {
        require(msg.sender == winner, "Not the winner");
        require(isComplete, "Lottery not completed");
        winner.transfer(address(this).balance);
        claimed = true;
    }

    function getPlayers() public view returns (address payable[] memory) {
        return players;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Frontend Implementation

The frontend leverages **React** for building a dynamic and responsive user interface, enabling users to interact with the smart contract seamlessly.

**Components:**

- **App.js:**
  - Sets up routing between the Home and PickWinner pages.
  - Provides navigation links for user accessibility.

- **Home.js:**
  - Manages user wallet connections via MetaMask.
  - Allows users to enter the lottery or claim prizes based on their status.
  - Displays lottery status and user-specific information.

- **PickWinner.js:**
  - Restricted to the manager account.
  - Enables the manager to pick a winner and view the lottery result.

- **constants.js:**
  - Stores the smart contract address and ABI for easy access across components.

**Key Implementations:**

- **Wallet Integration:**
  - Uses Ethers.js to connect to MetaMask and interact with the user's wallet.
  - Listens for account changes to update the UI dynamically.

- **Smart Contract Interaction:**
  - Connects to the deployed smart contract using its ABI and address.
  - Executes read and write operations on the contract based on user actions.

- **State Management:**
  - Utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage application state and side effects.

**Code Snippet:**

```jsx
// Home.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import constants from "./constants";

function Home() {
  const [currentAccount, setCurrentAccount] = useState("");
  const [contractInstance, setContractInstance] = useState(null);

        const address = await signer.getAddress();
        setCurrentAccount(address);

        window.ethereum.on("accountsChanged", (accounts) => {
          setCurrentAccount(accounts[0]);
        });
      } catch (err) {
        console.error("Error in loadBlockchainData:", err);
      }
    };

    const loadContractData = async () => {
      if (typeof window.ethereum === "undefined") return;
      try {
        const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
        await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);
        const signer = await provider.getSigner();

        const contractIns = new ethers.Contract(
          constants.contractAddress,
          constants.contractAbi,
          signer
        );

        const statusFromChain = await contractIns.isComplete();
        const winnerFromChain = await contractIns.getWinner();

        setContractInstance(contractIns);
        setStatus(statusFromChain);

        if (winnerFromChain === currentAccount) {
          setIsWinner(true);
        } else {
          setIsWinner(false);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error in loadContractData:", error);
      }
    };

    loadBlockchainData();
    loadContractData();
  }, [currentAccount]);

  const enterLottery = async () => {
    if (!contractInstance) return;
    try {
      const amountToSend = ethers.parseEther("0.1");
      const tx = await contractInstance.enter({ value: amountToSend });
      await tx.wait();
      console.log("Entered lottery!");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Error entering lottery:", err);
    }
  };

  const claimPrize = async () => {
    if (!contractInstance) return;
    try {
      const tx = await contractInstance.claimPrize();
      await tx.wait();
      console.log("Prize claimed!");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Error claiming prize:", err);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>Lottery Page</h1>
      <div className="button-container">
        {status ? (
          isWinner ? (
            <button className="enter-button" onClick={claimPrize}>
              Claim Prize
            </button>
          ) : (
            <p>You are not the winner</p>
          )
        ) : (
          <button className="enter-button" onClick={enterLottery}>
            Enter Lottery
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
